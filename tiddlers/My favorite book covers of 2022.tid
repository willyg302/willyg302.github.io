!! My top three

!!! 3. Gwen E. Kirby, //Shit Cassandra Saw//

I don't like this particular art style, but sometimes as a critic you have to set aside personal biases and admire a work for what it objectively is. This cover is eye-catching. This cover is captivating. When doing my ranking I kept bumping this one up and up for reasons I didn't fully understand. Okay, yeah, the title flames are cool, but what else? Even though I still don't know, I'm fully on board with this being in the top three.

!!! 2. Ling Ma, //Bliss Montage//

Among this year's fruit-themed entries, oranges take top spot. What stands out here is that it almost seems like a photo, as if they printed the text on a plastic bag and had a fun day shooting still life. I've about had my fill of titles that weave in and out of flowers and vines and such -- give me more creative methods of incorporating text! That the oranges comprise the entire background/palette is also worthy of mention.

!!! 1. Yiyun Li, //The Book of Goose//

HONK. This one hits all the notes. It's both serene and playful. Clean ukiyo-e minimalism, a strong focal point, flowing text (that fits the neck curve!), a smooth background gradient into brushed clouds. Where many others attempted to catch the eye with over-the-top complex illustrations, this manages to do the same with a semicircle. My jaw didn't drop for first place this year but given all its strengths the goose sits comfortably atop the podium.

!! Honorable mentions

[img[$:/images/book-covers-2022-honorable-mentions.png]]

# Maggie O'Farrell, //The Marriage Portrait//: I like how the text is revealed through alternating daggers of orange. Very striking.
# Judy I. Lin, //A Magic Steeped in Poison//: The coolest illustration of the year, especially the circling koi.
# Charles Simic, //No Land in Sight//: The year's top "void" cover (see below). There's something about those inverted hot air balloons.
# Malinda Lo, //A Scatter of Light//: Google this book, find a nice big image, and zoom in. The textures!
# Tom Lin, //The Thousand Crimes of Ming Tsu//: This first caught my eye in Powell's of Portland. I thought it was a great design then and still do now.
# Katherine Dunn, //Toad//: Once again, if you've got a short title use it to your advantage. Very clean illustration as well.
# Maggie Shipstead, //You Have a Friend in 10A//: Of course they had to design it like an aircraft safety card. Bonus points for the subtle humor in steps 2-4.
# Deborah Falaye, //Blood Scion//: The title looks like something I tried to make in Photoshop following an early-2000s tutorial, but the fiery swirling backdrop makes up for it.
# Erin Swan, //Walk the Vanished Earth//: Great colors, great illustration. Framing the title in the moon is cool, too.
# Barbara Kingsolver, //Demon Copperhead//: I might be a sucker for overflowing illustrated collage borders. Look at all the little details! Look at the shoes!
# Emiko Jean, //Tokyo Dreaming//: Not a huge fan of the super thin font, but love the paper cutout style.
# John Banville, //The Singularities//: There's a beautiful painterly feel to this one in the same vein as //The Terror// and //The Wager//. The singularity itself is ominous.
# Will Storr, //The Status Game//: Hands down the cleverest of the bunch given the book's subject.
# Dawn Winter, //Sedating Elaine//: Banana.
# Heather Radke, //Butts: A Backstory//: Extremely simple and provocative. Also wins the "best use of emoji" award.
# Stephen King, //Fairy Tale//: Finally a King book makes the list! Honestly his cover artists have been on fire since at least //The Outsider//. Here it's the title treatment that does it for me.

!! Closing thoughts

Two trends this year: fruit and the void. The first one tickled my fancy enough to get three species featured, and if the trend continues 2023's post might be a regular produce aisle. The second is arguably more interesting. In the honorable mentions we had //No Land in Sight// and //The Status Game//, but many others fell just below the cut: //Yoga// (Emmanuel Carr√®re), //Carnality// (Lina Wolff), //The Red Zone// (Chloe Caldwell), //Love// (Maayan Eitan), //Fear of Black Consciousness// (Lewis R. Gordon), //Acne// (Laura Chinn)...

Putting my stuffy academic analysis hat on, I'd like to say that a world still very much in the pits of a pandemic with a collective psyche running on fumes just wanted simple. Wanted //clean//. There's not much to these covers, but at least they're soothing. Looking back I feel like that was perfect for 2022.
