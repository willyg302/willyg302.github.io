title: An elegy on small plates
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I really wish more restaurants existed that emphasized small tasting portions (quarter-sized or less) for an affordable price (say, $3-5 casual or $6-10 fine dining). As someone with a low BMI and bird-sized appetite I'd be able to spend ~$20 for 5-6 items at a lower-end joint, rather than shelling out the same amount for a mountain of one thing that I have to later doggie-bag.

Some alternatives that I've considered, and why they don't quite work:

; Just eat at a buffet.
: For example, [[Golden Corral|https://www.goldencorral.com/]]'s dinner buffet is $16-19 for something like 60 items. [[Shady Maple Smorgasbord|https://www.shady-maple.com/smorgasbord/]], the largest buffet in the US, is $27-32 for an even larger selection. These are outliers, however -- a middle-tier buffet will set you back $40+, and high-end ones in places like Vegas are consistently closer to $100 a head. I actually love buffets because I get to sample so many different items, but I never eat enough to justify their cost.

; Move to another country.
: American food intake is [[among the highest in the world|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_food_energy_intake]], which is not at all helped by our portion sizes. I can typically finish about half the given portion when I eat out, whereas when I visited Japan earlier this year I finished most of my meals. So yes, relocating might help somewhat...but I want to try multiple menu items in one go, not just be able to finish all of one.

; Order a set meal or omakase.
: [[Set meals|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_d%27h%C3%B4te]] sometimes consist of many courses, giving up some choice for the opportunity to try a curated slice of the restaurant's menu. [[Omakase|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omakase]] pushes this further, leaving everything in the chef's hands. These options are great for first-time diners and I can see why kitchens would prefer them, too (it's hard to make arbitrary small plates on-demand). That being said, it's unfortunate that they often leave out the most special dishes.

; Order only appetizers or tapas.
: Per their names, [[appetizers|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hors_d%27oeuvre]] and [[tapas|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapas]] are meant to be smaller snack-sized dishes ordered before the main meal and priced accordingly. This works well if appetizers include some stars of the show (like the [[signature egg toast|https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XO1KlfYuNxM]] at Jean-Georges), but usually I feel like I'm missing out. For example, a well-known trick at [[Haidilao Hot Pot|https://www.haidilao.com/]] is to order a plain water base and load up on the $3 sauce bar, but are you //really// enjoying hot pot at that point?

; Share entrées with friends.
: ~~Bold of you to assume I have friends.~~ Assuming your friends are up for it, this is probably the most realistic alternative until restaurants catch on. As my friend circle has shrunk it's rare to pull off "just a taste" splits with a table of 4-6, but whenever I grab dinner with my bestest of friends we do tend to swap whatever we order. Now if only they had half portions and we could order two each...

; Try a food walk.
: Like most sizable cities, Seattle has no shortage of yearly food events -- [[Ballard SeafoodFest|https://www.seafoodfest.org/]], [[Bite of Seattle|https://biteofseattle.com/]], [[CID Food Walk|https://www.seattlechinatownid.com/experiences/food-walk-series]], [[Fremont Fair|https://fremontfair.com/]], and [[Panda Fest|https://www.pandafests.com/]], just to name a few. Some of these do offer small plates ($6 from select vendors at the Bite, and $8 items at CID), but most vendors still sell full portions (like [[whatever the hell this is|https://fremontoktoberfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/22FOKT_SPONSOR-037.jpg]] for $18). I never understood this: why go to a place with 20-30 tents/trucks, only to fill up at maybe one or two of them?

; You literally just described Genki Sushi.
: True, [[Genki Sushi|https://www.genkisushiusa.com/]] and other [[conveyor belt sushi|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt_sushi]] chains are exactly what I want: $2-6 plates of 1-3 pieces each, mix and match to your heart's content. Now can we get this for a steakhouse? An Italian restaurant? A wing spot?
